# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan, a Software Engineer with 6+ years of professional experience (including remote & freelance) from Panama who has lived in New Zealand for the past 8 years. I was born and raised in PanamÃ¡, so Spanish is my native language. Currently based in Panama but wanting to relocate to Spain in mid-September.

Before becoming a full-stack web developer, I started my career as a game programmer. That skillset has given me some awesome opportunities to fill a niche, while allowing me to travel the world and discover new cultures.

I currently run my own dev agency where I co-lead a team of 3 (2 developers + 1 artist) and build 3D/XR products that run on any web browser. My favorite technologies at the moment are TypeScript, React, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Python, NextJS, and am learning Elixir.
