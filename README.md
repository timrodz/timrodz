## Hello! Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan Morais, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I was born and raised in Herrera, PanamÃ¡, and Spanish is my native language. I moved to New Zealand in 2015, and still reside here.

I learned how to create games before I knew how to make web apps. I'm an experienced game developer who re-trained/gained knowledge in full stack web development. If you ask me what I prefer, I really can't sayâ€”Both are equally awesome in different ways!

### ðŸŒ± Favourite technologies:

- Python / Flask, Pandas
- C# / Unity, .NET
- TypeScript / React, three.js
- C++ / Unreal Engine

### ðŸŒ³ Things I've built / worked on:

- [Clusterduck (Game / iOS, Android)](https://pikpok.com/games/clusterduck/)
- [I Am Monster (Game / iOS, Android)](https://pikpok.com/games/i-am-monster/)
- Full Stack web apps (Flask + React)
- Networking solutions (REST APIs/Graph APIs)
- ETL pipelines (Python, Pandas, AWS Redshift, AWS S3)
- Stock exchanges (ASX, NZX, NYSE, NASDAQ)
- Game UIs (Unity, 2D/2.5D/3D)
